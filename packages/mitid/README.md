# mitid-client

Log in to Danish services with MitID, from Python. No browser, no Selenium.

Every MitID-protected site works the same way. An identity broker hands the
browser an `aux` blob, the browser feeds that to MitID's JavaScript core client,
and the core client hands back an authorisation code the broker exchanges for a
session. This package is a Python stand-in for that core client, plus the
brokers and the two ways of showing a login to the person doing it.

```python
import requests
from mitid.brokers import nemlogin

session = nemlogin.new_session()
final = nemlogin.log_in(session, "https://www.tinglysning.dk/...", "MyMitIDUserID")
# `session` now carries the service's own login cookies.
```

## What is in it

| module | what it does |
| --- | --- |
| `mitid.authenticate` | an `aux` blob and a user ID in, an authorisation code out |
| `mitid.core` | the core client: SRP, the app channel, the QR frames, polling |
| `mitid.srp` | SRP-6a and the AES-GCM bits the authenticators need |
| `mitid.brokers.nemlogin` | NemLog-in, which fronts the whole Danish public sector |
| `mitid.store` | keeps a login's cookies between runs, 0600, in `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` |
| `mitid.ui.console` | status lines, a scannable QR and a code box, on stderr |
| `mitid.ui.tui` | the same login as a Textual screen (`[textual]` extra) |

The protocol reports everything through callbacks — `on_status`, `on_qr`,
`on_otp`, `ask_token_code`, `choose_identity` — and draws nothing itself. That
is the whole reason the same login can be a few lines on stderr in one program
and a screen in another.

## Logging in

Two methods. `APP` sends a request to the MitID app and shows either a QR to
scan or a six-digit code to type, whichever the app asks for; `TOKEN` takes six
digits from a code token followed by the account password.

```python
from mitid.ui.console import LoginConsole

screen = LoginConsole()
final = nemlogin.log_in(
    session, START_URL, user_id,
    on_status=screen.status,     # progress, and which service is asking
    on_qr=screen.qr,             # a QR matrix, redrawn in place each second
    on_otp=screen.otp,           # a code to type into the app
    ask_token_code=screen.ask,   # only with method=mitid.TOKEN
    choose_identity=screen.choose,  # when one MitID unlocks several identities
)
```

In a Textual application, the same login is a screen:

```python
from functools import partial
from mitid.ui.tui import MitIDLoginScreen

result = await self.push_screen_wait(
    MitIDLoginScreen(partial(nemlogin.log_in, session, START_URL))
)
```

`MitIDLoginScreen` calls what you give it with the five callbacks above and
dismisses with whatever it returns, or `None` if the user gave up.

## Keeping the session

A login costs a tap on a phone, so it must not happen once per request. What it
produces is a set of cookies, and `CookieStore` keeps those between runs:

```python
from mitid.store import CookieStore

store = CookieStore("yourapp", "service-session.json",
                    session_factory=nemlogin.new_session)
store.save(session, user_id=user_id)

restored = store.restore()          # (session, saved) or None
if restored:
    session, saved = restored
    idle = store.idle_for(saved["saved_at"])
```

Whether the service still honours those cookies is between you and the service —
ask it. Most of them end a session that has sat idle for half an hour.

## Installing

```sh
uv add mitid-client              # or: pip install mitid-client
uv add "mitid-client[textual]"   # if you want the Textual screen
```

fixes can be dropped straight in when MitID changes it; the only edit is that
what the user needs to see leaves through callbacks instead of the logger.

## Please be sensible

This logs in as you, to services that hold real data about real people, using a
national identity system. Use it for your own accounts and your own data. Rate
limits, terms of service and the law all still apply.
