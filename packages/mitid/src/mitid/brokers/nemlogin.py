"""Log in to a Danish public-sector site through NemLog-in, using MitID.

NemLog-in is the government's identity broker: tinglysning.dk, borger.dk,
skat.dk and the rest all delegate to it over SAML, so the flow below is not
tinglysning-specific. Point `log_in` at any NemLog-in-protected URL and it will
come back with the session cookie that URL was guarding.

The dance, once you strip the redirects away:

    1. GET the protected URL. It 302s to nemlog-in.mitid.dk/login/mitid.
    2. POST login/mitid/initialize. NemLog-in answers with the `aux` blob
       that MitID's core client needs.
    3. Run the MitID authentication (see mitid/) to get an authorisation code.
    4. POST that code back to login/mitid. NemLog-in answers with a signed
       SAML assertion in an auto-submitting form.
    5. POST the form. The service checks the assertion and sets its session.

Step 2 is the part the published reference scripts get wrong: they scrape an
`"Aux":"..."` string straight out of the login page's HTML, which NemLog-in
stopped shipping. It now sits behind that XHR instead, gated by a "Fortsæt til
login" button.
