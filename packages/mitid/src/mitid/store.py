"""Keep a logged-in session between runs, so the phone is only needed rarely.

A MitID login costs the user a tap on their phone, which means it must not
happen once per request. What a login actually produces is a set of cookies for
the service that asked for it, and those stay good until the service decides
the session has idled out - so the cookies are what gets kept.

Nothing here knows which service the cookies belong to. Name the store after
your application and, if it logs in to more than one place, after the service:

    store = CookieStore("yaybo", "tinglysning-session.json",
                        session_factory=nemlogin.new_session)

The file lands in the XDG config directory, 0600, because a live login to a
government register in someone's name is not an ordinary cache file.
